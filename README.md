> A small node rest api to get more familiar with the nodejs express framework.

## How To Run

* `cd` into the directory.
* Make sure you have are running a MongoDB server.
* Run `yarn dev:build` to bundle the project with webpack.
* Run `yarn dev` to start the project.

It's a very _very_ basic blog api with authentication.

To quickly test some of the endpoints after running the server you can download and import the postman collection.
